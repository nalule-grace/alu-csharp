This README file serves as a guide to understanding and utilizing essential data structures in the C# programming language: arrays, lists, dictionaries, and the foreach loop.

1. What are Collections in C#?

Collections in C# are a fundamental concept for storing and manipulating data in a structured manner. They provide a way to group related items together, offering efficient access, retrieval, and management of data elements. Common collection types include:

Arrays: Ordered sequences of elements of the same data type.
Lists: Dynamically growing collections similar to arrays but offering more flexibility in adding and removing elements.
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs where each value is associated with a unique key, allowing for fast retrieval based on keys.
