C# Delegates and Events Exercise
Overview

This repository contains a series of C# exercises demonstrating the use of delegates and events. Each exercise builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and techniques.

Exercises:

Universal Health:

Introduces the Player class with basic properties and a PrintHealth() method.
Demonstrates encapsulation and object-oriented principles.
Damage Delegation:

Introduces delegates to handle damage and healing actions.
Uses delegates to decouple the calculation and application of damage and healing.
Validation:

Validates the player's health to ensure it stays within the maximum and minimum limits.
Uses a ValidateHP() method to enforce these constraints.
Modified Behavior:

Introduces an enum Modifier to modify damage and healing values.
Uses a delegate to calculate the modified value based on the modifier.
Eventful:

Implements an event-based mechanism to notify listeners about changes in the player's health.
Uses the EventHandler delegate and custom event arguments to provide detailed information about the health change.
How to Use:

Clone this repository.
Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
Run the Main method in each exercise to see the output.
Learning Objectives:

Understand the concept of delegates and events in C#.
Implement delegates to encapsulate behavior and pass it as arguments.
Use events to notify other objects about changes in state.
Apply object-oriented principles to create well-structured and reusable code.
Practice using delegates and events to create flexible and modular applications.
